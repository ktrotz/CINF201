<h1> Welcome to Hyperbolic Math Contests! </h1>

<p>
If you are a high-schooler looking to train for competitive mathematics, then this is the website for you. Every month, three new key problems will be posed. They will focus on one key concept, but each one will have its own twist. In the following month, the solutions will be revealed and some optimal techniques will be discussed in detail. Once you have struggled with each set of questions, the techniques will serve to push you towards improving your competition skill set.
</p>

<p>
Also, once per year (in March), we offer an online competition of ten questions. It is a timed event and it will score you on accuracy and speed. Solutions and scores will be available as soon as the competition window ends. <a href="lesson8-page2.html">Check out our most recent competition</a>.
